# Surface & Texture DNA — "Material Consistency"

## Overview

The Anamalia Prompt Assembler uses a comprehensive texture system that ensures material consistency across all renders. Each texture directive is codified into sacred phrases that must be used consistently to maintain the "felted puppet realism" aesthetic.

## Texture Continuity Principles

### 1. Character Material DNA
- **Primary Material**: Finely felted wool with visible fiber texture
- **Facial Features**: Hyper-realistic eyes and nose with natural reflections
- **Body Surfaces**: Matte felted surfaces for body
- **Specular Highlights**: Slight specular highlights on eyes and nostrils only

### 2. Render Style Consistency
- **Photography Style**: Like a real miniature puppet under macro lens lighting
- **Depth of Field**: Shallow depth of field for focus
- **Realism Level**: Cinematic realism, not cartoon or illustration
- **Lighting Integration**: Works with all lighting profiles

### 3. Material Hierarchy
1. **Character Body**: Felted wool (canonical)
2. **Wardrobe**: Natural fabrics with appropriate textures
3. **Props**: Authentic materials (wood, ceramic, metal, etc.)
4. **Scenes**: Environmental materials matching the setting

## Codified Texture Phrases

### Sacred Phrases (Never Alter Unless Intentional)

#### 1. Felted Wool Character DNA (Canonical)
```
"Character crafted from finely felted wool with visible fiber texture, 
hyper-realistic eyes and nose with natural reflections, matte felted 
surfaces for body, slight specular highlights on eyes and nostrils."
```

#### 2. Stop-Motion Puppet Realism
```
"Photographed like a real miniature puppet under macro lens lighting, 
shallow depth of field, cinematic realism."
```

#### 3. Fabric Wardrobe Materials
```
"Wardrobe items in natural fabrics with visible weave texture, soft drape, 
minimal specular highlights, matte fabric finish."
```

#### 4. Wooden Prop Surfaces
```
"Props crafted from aged wood with visible grain texture, weathered patina, 
warm wood reflections, hand-crafted finish."
```

#### 5. Ceramic & Pottery
```
"Ceramic items with smooth glaze finish, subtle hand-crafted imperfections, 
controlled specular highlights, authentic pottery feel."
```

#### 6. Metal Hardware
```
"Metal hardware with aged patina, slight oxidation, authentic metallic 
reflections, weathered finish."
```

#### 7. Glass & Crystal
```
"Glass items with clear transparency, subtle light refraction, authentic 
glass reflections, crystal clarity."
```

#### 8. Leather & Hide
```
"Leather items with natural grain texture, supple surface, authentic 
leather sheen, hand-tooled finish."
```

#### 9. Paper & Cardboard
```
"Paper items with visible fiber texture, slight age yellowing, matte finish, 
authentic paper feel."
```

#### 10. Stone & Mineral
```
"Stone items with natural grain texture, mineral veining, authentic stone 
reflections, natural finish."
```

## Implementation Rules

### 1. Consistency Requirements
- **Never alter** codified texture phrases unless intentionally changing materials
- **Always include** the complete phrase in every prompt
- **Maintain** the same material vocabulary across all renders
- **Preserve** the "felted puppet realism" aesthetic

### 2. Material Hierarchy
When combining materials:
1. **Character DNA** always takes precedence for body materials
2. **Wardrobe materials** follow their specific texture directives
3. **Props** use appropriate material textures
4. **Environmental** materials match scene requirements

### 3. Quality Control
- **Material Authenticity**: Must match real-world material properties
- **Texture Consistency**: Same material = same texture description
- **Specular Control**: Appropriate reflections for each material
- **Render Style**: Consistent photography approach

## Technical Specifications

### Material Properties
1. **Felted Wool**: Visible fiber texture, matte surfaces
2. **Natural Fabrics**: Woven texture, soft drape
3. **Aged Wood**: Grain texture, weathered patina
4. **Glazed Ceramic**: Smooth glaze, subtle imperfections
5. **Aged Metal**: Patina, slight oxidation
6. **Clear Glass**: Transparency, subtle refraction
7. **Natural Leather**: Grain texture, supple surface
8. **Aged Paper**: Fiber texture, slight yellowing
9. **Natural Stone**: Grain texture, mineral veining

### Specular Properties
- **Character Body**: Matte (no specular)
- **Eyes & Nostrils**: Slight specular highlights
- **Fabric**: Minimal specular, matte finish
- **Wood**: Warm reflections
- **Ceramic**: Controlled specular highlights
- **Metal**: Metallic reflections
- **Glass**: Glass reflections
- **Leather**: Leather sheen
- **Paper**: Matte finish
- **Stone**: Stone reflections

## Benefits

1. **Visual Continuity**: All renders appear in the same material world
2. **Authentic Aesthetic**: Realistic stop-motion puppet feel
3. **Material Coherence**: Consistent material properties
4. **Scalable System**: Easy to add new material types
5. **Quality Control**: Measurable material standards

## Usage in Prompts

Every generated prompt must include the appropriate texture phrases:

### Character Prompts
```
"A rhino named Ruby in a welcoming pose at a miniature cobblestone piazza 
with warm, directional late-afternoon sunlight from front-left at 45°, 
soft fill light from right, subtle floor shadow, gently contrasted 
stop-motion studio lighting. Character crafted from finely felted wool 
with visible fiber texture, hyper-realistic eyes and nose with natural 
reflections, matte felted surfaces for body, slight specular highlights 
on eyes and nostrils. Photographed like a real miniature puppet under 
macro lens lighting, shallow depth of field, cinematic realism."
```

### Wardrobe Integration
```
"Wearing a sun hat in natural straw with visible weave texture, soft drape, 
minimal specular highlights, matte fabric finish."
```

### Props Integration
```
"Holding a teacup in smooth glaze finish, subtle hand-crafted imperfections, 
controlled specular highlights, authentic pottery feel."
```

This ensures that every render maintains the same material consistency, creating a cohesive tactile universe where the "felted puppet realism" is preserved across all characters, wardrobe, and props.
